# Kata FizzBuzz Rules

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.   
For multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number.  
For the multiples of 5 print "Buzz".  
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz.

## Kata Rules

### First Rule

You can write no production code except to pass a failing test case.

### Second Rule

You can only write enougth of a test case to demonstrate a failure (or a compiler error).

### Third Rule

You can only write enought production code to pass the currently failing test case.

## TDD

**RED** : make a failing test case
**GREEN** : make the test pass
**REFACTOR** : remove code duplication
